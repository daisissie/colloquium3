Tinker Creek,,,"Within months of Tickets’s appearance, however, the book was completely over-shadowed by the release of Pilgrim at Tinker Creek. | Dillard lived quietly on Tinker Creek in Virginia’s Roanoke Valley, observing the natural world, taking notes, and reading voluminously in a wide variety of disciplines, including theology, philosophy, natural science, and physics. | I live by a creek, Tinker Creek, in a valley in Virginia’s Blue Ridge. | I think of this house clamped to the side of Tinker Creek as an anchor-hold. | West of the house, Tinker Creek makes a sharp loop, so that the creek is both in back of the house, south of me, and also on the other side of the road, north of me. | When I slide under a barbed-wire fence, cross a field, and run over a sycamore trunk felled across the water, I’m on a little island shaped like a tear in the middle of Tinker Creek. | It must have been that terrible yellow plant I saw pushing through the flood-damp soil near the log by Tinker Creek, the plant as fleshy and featureless as a slug, that erupted through the floor of my brain as I slept, and burgeoned into the dream of fecundity that woke me up. | After the flood last year I found a big tulip-tree limb that had been wind-thrown into Tinker Creek. | I was stock-still, looking deep into Tinker Creek from a spot on the bank opposite the house, watching a group of bluegills stare and hang motionless near the bottom of a deep, sunlit pool. | I wonder whether what I see and seem to understand about nature is merely one of the accidents of freedom, repeated by chance before my eyes, or whether it has any counterpart in the worlds beyond Tinker Creek. | The whole universe is a swarm of those wild, wary energies, the sun that glistens from the wet hairs on a muskrat’s back and the stars which the mountains obscure on the horizon but which catch from on high in Tinker Creek. | This magic garden is just on the other side of the oxbow in Tinker Creek; it is secluded because it is hard to approach. | The cottage is mostly windows—there are five—and the windows are entirely broken, so that my life inside the cottage is mostly Tinker Creek and mud dauber wasps. | I think of the swimming bluegill I saw at the Lawsons’, upstream in Tinker Creek on the other side of Tinker Mountain. | I was standing at the bridge over Tinker Creek, at the southern foot of a very steep hill. | This honeysuckle was an odor already only half-remembered, a breath of the summer past, the Lucas cliffs and overgrown fence by Tinker Creek, a drugged sweetness that had almost cloyed on those moisture-laden nights, now refined to a wary trickle in the air, a distillation pure and rare, scarcely known and mostly lost, and heading south. | The quarry path parallels Tinker Creek far upstream from my house, and when the woods broke into clearing and pasture, I followed the creek banks down. | This Tinker Creek! | Where Tinker Creek flows under the sycamore log bridge to the tear-shaped island, it is slow and shallow, fringed thinly in cattail marsh. | I straddle the sycamore log bridge over Tinker Creek in the summer. | Then one day I was walking along Tinker Creek thinking of nothing at all and I saw the tree with the lights in it. | Everywhere paths unclog; in late fall and winter, and only then, can I scale the cliff to the Lucas orchard, circle the forested quarry pond, or follow the left-hand bank of Tinker Creek downstream. | On my right a woods thickly overgrown with creeper descended the hill’s slope to Tinker Creek. | The frogs of Tinker Creek are slathered in mud, mud at their eyes and mud at their nostrils; their damp skins absorb a muddy oxygen, and so they pass the dreaming winter. | It is the spit of land enclosed in the oxbow of Tinker Creek. | Any time you care to get in your car and drive across the country and over the mountains, come into our valley, cross Tinker Creek, drive up the road to the house, walk across the yard, knock on the door and ask to come in and talk about the weather, you’d be welcome. | It was a sort of Tinker Creek to her, from which she bore lightly in every direction an invisible news. | Passing the house again, deciding not to fetch gloves, I walked north to the hill by the place where the steers come to drink from Tinker Creek. | Shadow Creek is the blue subterranean stream that chills Carvin’s Creek and Tinker Creek; it cuts like ice under the ribs of the mountains, Tinker and Dead Man. | Two weeks ago, in the dark of night, I bundled up and quit the house for Tinker Creek. | But that night Tinker Creek had vanished, usurped, and Shadow Creek blocked its banks. | Once, when Tinker Creek had frozen inches thick at a wide part near the bridge, I found a pileated woodpecker in the sky by its giant shadow flapping blue on the white ice below. | If I stay at home I preserve the illusion that what is happening on Tinker Creek is the very newest thing, that I’m at the very vanguard and cutting edge of each new season. | II
I am sitting under a sycamore by Tinker Creek. | This sycamore above me, below me, by Tinker Creek, is a case in point; the sight of it crowds my brain with an assortment of diverting thoughts, all as present to me as these slivers of pressure from grass on my elbow’s skin. | It is hard to understand how the same tree could thrive both choking along Pittsburgh’s Penn Avenue and slogging knee-deep in Tinker Creek. | This isn’t Tinker Creek. | I am sitting under a sycamore by Tinker Creek. | Tinker Creek doesn’t back up, pushed up its own craw, from the Roanoke River; it flows down, easing, from the northern, unseen side of Tinker Mountain. | But, as in the classic version of the great chain, the pure trickle that leaks from the unfathomable heart of Tinker Mountain, this Tinker Creek, widens, taking shape and cleaving banks, weighted with the live and intricate impurities of time, as it descends to me, to where I happen to find myself, in this intermediate spot, halfway between here and there. | But maybe I think things are more difficult than they are, because once, after I had waded and slogged in tennis shoes a quarter of a mile upstream in Tinker Creek, a boy hailed me from the tangled bank. | Tinker Creek where I live is too fast and rough for most of them. | I would like to see it all, to understand it, but I must start somewhere, so I try to deal with the giant water bug in Tinker Creek and the flight of three hundred redwings from an Osage orange, with the goldfish bowl and the snakeskin, and let those who dare worry about the birthrate and population explosion among solar systems. | Again, of an ostracod, a common freshwater crustacean of the sort I crunch on by the thousands every time I set foot in Tinker Creek, I read, “There is one eye situated at the fore-end of the animal. | Tinker Creek is out of its four-foot banks, way out, and it’s still coming. | The bridge over by the Bings’ on Tinker Creek looks like it’s about to go. | The handle isn’t so long that they don’t have to stand on the bridge, in Tinker Creek. | On the same day that I was standing on bridges here over Tinker Creek, a friend, Lee Zacharias, was standing on a bridge in Richmond over the James River."
Virginia,,,"Dillard lived quietly on Tinker Creek in Virginia’s Roanoke Valley, observing the natural world, taking notes, and reading voluminously in a wide variety of disciplines, including theology, philosophy, natural science, and physics. | In November, back in Virginia, I fooled around with the idea and started filling out five-by-seven index cards with notes from years of reading. | I live by a creek, Tinker Creek, in a valley in Virginia’s Blue Ridge. | A southwest Virginia naturalist noted in his journal for April, 1896, “Mourning-cloaks are plentiful but broken, having lived through the winter.” | Sometimes here in Virginia at sunset low clouds on the southern or northern horizon are completely invisible in the lighted sky. | They have favorite roosting sites to which they return winter after winter; apparently southwest Virginia is their idea of Miami Beach. | Radford, Virginia, had a little stink of its own a few years ago. | I am dazed from a long day of interstate driving homeward; I pull in at a gas station in Nowhere, Virginia, north of Lexington. | I laughed all the way back to Virginia. | The road to Grundy, Virginia, is, as you might expect, a narrow scrawl scribbled all over the most improbably peaked and hunched mountains you ever saw. | Here in Virginia the trees reach enormous proportions, especially in the lowlands on banksides. | In winter the Eskimos could travel with dog sleds and visit; with the coming of warm weather, their pathways, like mine in Virginia, closed. | If you ever drive through Virginia on the new interstate highway between Christiansburg and Salem, and you feel a slight dip in the paving under your wheels, then loose thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place whereon thou drivest is Jean White’s horse. | Here in Virginia alone it killed twelve people and ruined 166 million dollars worth of property."
Roanoke Valley,,,"Dillard lived quietly on Tinker Creek in Virginia’s Roanoke Valley, observing the natural world, taking notes, and reading voluminously in a wide variety of disciplines, including theology, philosophy, natural science, and physics."
South America,,,"In minutely detailed descriptions of a solar eclipse, visits to South America and the Galapagos Islands, and other, more commonplace events and locations, Dillard continues “the pilgrimage begun at Tinker Creek with an acuity of eye and ear that is matched by an ability to communicate a sense of wonder,” stated Beaufort Cranford in the Detroit News. | Copperheads are not big enough or venomous enough to kill adult humans readily, but they do account for far and away the greatest number of poisonous snakebites in North America: there are so many of them, and people, in the Eastern woodlands."
the Galapagos Islands,,,"In minutely detailed descriptions of a solar eclipse, visits to South America and the Galapagos Islands, and other, more commonplace events and locations, Dillard continues “the pilgrimage begun at Tinker Creek with an acuity of eye and ear that is matched by an ability to communicate a sense of wonder,” stated Beaufort Cranford in the Detroit News."
the Pacific Northwest,,,"Dillard ventured into new territory with her 1992 publication, The Living, a sprawling historical novel set in the Pacific Northwest."
